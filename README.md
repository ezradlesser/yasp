Yet Another Software Package[r]

# recommendation

- use within a conda env (it does make life simpler ;-)
- packages here likely do not exist in conda or need a custom install

# to do

- configuration - write function that would set defaults - --prefix for example
- this could retrieved to be used by other packages
